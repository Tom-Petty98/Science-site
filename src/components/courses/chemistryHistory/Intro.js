      <h4>2200 BC</h4><p><b>--Bronze age </b></p>
      <h4>800 BC</h4><p><b>--Iron age begins </b></p>
      <h4>430 BC</h4><p><b>--Atoms. </b> Described as the smallest unit no longer able to be cut in half.</p>
      <h4>300 BC</h4>
      <p><b>--Aristotle declared all matter was made up of the four elements (fire, water, air, earth). </b>
      Alchemists influenced by these ideas belived that substances could be broken down and recreated into 
      new things. Thus they attempted to transmute cheap metals to gold. The substance used for this 
      conversion was called the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
      <h4>1649</h4><p><b>--Discovery of Phosphorous. </b>First element to be fully purified and categorized.</p>
      <h4>1700â€™s</h4><p><b>--Phlogiston. </b>When a substance is burned, phlogiston was supposedly added 
      from the air to the flame of the burning object.</p>
      <h4>1774</h4><p><b>--Discovery of oxygen. </b>Preistly charachterised air that lacked oxygen as dephlogisticated air.
      Later Lavoisier completed further experiments and realized that "active ingredient" in air was an element that he named Oxygen</p>
      <h4>1908</h4><p><b>Mendeleve publishes his periodic table. </b></p>

      <p>Some unreactive elements tend to be found pure in nature these elements include; copper, gold, silver, tin, lead, mercury....
        However most matter is made up of compounds (mixtures of elements). The bronze age hit full swing when it was discoved that
        melting copper and tin together created a metal alloy called bronze. This metal had useful properties, such as strength,
        ductility, or machinability. Iron is the 4th most common element in the earths crust by weight. Thus learning how to extract iron 
        from iron ore kickstarted the iron age. However the first element to be discovered after ancient times was Phosphorous in 1649.
        
        In this intro to chemistry we will learn the experiments used to find key elements. Due to the technology of their time most experiments
        are fairly simple and will allow us to build up scientific reasoning, general thiking and fundermentals. </p>
